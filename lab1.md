# Lab Report 1: Remote Access Tutorial

First, we need to set up Visual Studio Code. After downloading the installer [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), run the installer and follow the instructions. Once Visual Studio Code has been installed, open it. You should see something like this:

Now, we can open a terminal in Visual Studio Code. On Mac OS, this can be done by pressing Control+Shift+`. Additionally, there should be a "New Terminal" button in the "Terminal" menu in the menubar.

To connect remotely to your account, we need to use `ssh`. With the terminal open, type `ssh`, then a space, and then the username of you CSE 15L account followed by `@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. Your command should look something like this

```
ssh cse15l23w██@ieng5.ucsd.edu
```
